    <h4>Thank you for being a part of my journey!</h4>
    <p>
        We barely contact each other throughout school days since we're all too busy doing our work, and it's just unreal to me that 
        I could still be talking to you after months without contacting at all. 
        <br><br>
        I actually still miss you as a friend from time to time when I got nothing to do, so I always keep myself busy. 
        Thank you for texting me and sharing your life with me the other day! I wanted to call you sometimes before, but I figured that there's no reason 
        for me, as a friend, to call you randomly and purposelessly.
        <br><br>
        This "Will you be my valentine" is just for Valentine's Day. Just like how you mentioned before that we never know what's going to happen in the future, 
        I wanna do something for you when I had time. 
        <br><br>
        I know you can keep up your grades and get the chance to study abroad once again! 
        <br><br>
        I'll always be rooting for you!
    </p>
